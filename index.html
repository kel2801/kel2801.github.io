<h1 style="background-color:lightsalmon;color:mediumblue"> Interest in IT </h1>
<p style="background-color:lightgreen;">
_ My interest in IT is coding and solving computer issues. Because I was impressed by the logical and accurate of a code which is needed to make a software, or a program runs correctly and effectively without having mistaken. Besides, I usually deal with the computer issues, each time solving I was interested by how the problem occur and how to fix it effectively. <br><br>

_ My interest in IT start when I was in high school, on that time I get to know how to make a code and how to fix computer issues. Then start practicing with some simple math calculations and practice fixing problems from the simple one to the complicated one. 

_ Yes, a particular event as well as a person both sparked my interest. About an event, when I was in grade 12, in an informatics lesson the teacher taught about coding and how to make a code that do a math calculation then gave me and my class an amount of time to practice the activities by ourselves. After that practicing time, I started to find interest in IT when I success in making a logical code and make the program calculated correctly. Otherwise, I usually watch and learn from a technical supporter who is my mom’s friend each time he fixes my computer problems and he explain specifically about the problem occurred and how he is going to fix it.<br><br> 

_ I choose to come to RMIT because I see that it is the best environment to learn about IT with a lot of modern technical devices, many experience teachers who can teach in an effective way, and easy to create relationships to involve in projects while studying to extend knowledge by learning from each other. <br><br>

_ I expect to learn more about coding like what programs that we will write codes, types of code, areas that related to IT such as data, security, networking, a little bit of robotics, software. Besides academic knowledge, I also want to learn the way to think logically and accurately, skills that is needed to do the teamwork effectively during my studies. <br><br>

<h1 style="background-color:springgreen;color:indigo" > Project idea </h1> 
 
 <p style="background-color:magenta;"> 
  This Project is going to be focus on developing nutrition apps for a smartphone. In recent, most of every people are concern about their health, their daily diet and habit. Besides doctors, nutrition advisors, news which is talking about health and nutrition, there are many different kinds of application which are commonly used to support people in a fast and convenient way such as Fitbit, S Health, and Calorie Counter & Diet Tracker by MyFitnessPal. Due to the demand about a professional useful app and nutrition analyzing for every types of person, I will develop an app containing functions that can satisfy both conditions. <br><br>

  This developing nutrition app will be very interesting and useful if it is unique compared to the applications that people have used so far and because health is the most important thing of humans so, a Good app to support people in their daily routines and lifestyles is essential. In particular, this project will make a strong impression on the expectation of a more professional application of people based on today's modern technology. In addition, up to now, people have often relied on the advice of a doctor or dietitian to plan for themselves, instead of having to spend too much time like that, an application like "a friend" by their side  will support and help people to analyze, select and adjust their own living routine. “There are about 75.5 million people in United States use many different apps related to health. However not all of the people are satisfied with the quality of the app that they use. Due to that reason, developing a professional app related to health is a good solution for that issue.<br><br>

  In terms of functional features, the professional nutrition application will have features such as information tools, food analysis tools, recommendations and tracking diets. The first will be about the information tool, which provides people with complete information about nutrition, diets, everything in this tool is very reliable and ensures accuracy. body. More specifically, the information contained in it will be about all the nutrients in each type of food, diets suitable for many different health cases, and positive articles about benefits of successful dieters and negative articles about cases of harmful effects and unpredictable consequences for people to learn and filter out appropriate regimes. It suits you with the motivation from news articles to have the best possible nutrition for your health. Next is a food analysis tool, which can carefully analyze the database of nutrition in foods such as how many calories they contain, which nutrients they have, and which ones are bad for their health. , or whether the food is a good fit for your diet when scanning the barcode on the product or scanning the food directly or typing a particular food or menu item it will appear a detailed and accurate analysis results table. Another feature that is indispensable in the professional nutrition application is counseling and diet tracking. This feature is like a miniature consultant but very "knowledgeable" can help people find or select a specific diet rather than diet and how to behave properly. the most appropriate and logical when we enter data about health status, weight, diet that have been used to date, the status of activities, or enter the goal or regime that we want to pursue. The "consultant" will then result in one or two or three modes that the system finds most appropriate based on the data we entered earlier with helpful hints. After selecting a suitable regime, the system will automatically update the information on the regime on a plan table with a schedule, then will arrange different amounts of nutrition or diet by day, Every week, every month as well as training regime, people can rely on that plan and make their own menu and practice plan. The system will help to track by after 1 day, log into the system and then follow the daily activities then enter data about the activities on that day such as what to practice, eat How to drink, the system will give an assessment of whether it is okay or not according to the prescribed regime or not.<br><br>
 
      Open-source software (OSS) is any software which is distributed with its source code available for modification. That means it usually includes a license for programmers to change the software like fix bugs, improve functions, or adapt the software to suit their own demand. In addition, it is also used for creating an application without required humans to pay money. This is a unique difference compared to the other software because for the other software when people want to create or develop or make a change of an application, they have to pay money for the license before they can access to do their work. For OSS, there are many different licenses allow programmers to modify the software with various conditions attached.<br><br>

     To get involved in this nutrition app development project, the skills needed for before, during, and after work are teamwork skills because this project can be a project. Because this group has so many segments and stages, this skill is very important to be able to work well together and create a professional application, the skill of searching and selecting information is also an important skill. Equally because the application will contain a lot of necessary and accurate information for humans, the information must be carefully screened so as not to fall into the unconscious duplication of other applications, skills. Writing code is an indispensable skill to create an application and must be very careful because writing code is an important step In order to structure and operate an application if without this skill will definitely occur errors in coding and applications will surely fail.<br><br>


    If the project of developing a nutrition application for smartphones succeeds, it will not only create a new step for modern technology but also show the progress in developing software applications for a smartphone. The initial issues that are mentioned in this project will be solved in the most satisfactory way when the product is released, satisfying the demand for use and the quality of human services compared to the applications did not satisfy them. This development will have an impact on health and nutrition issues to help humans solving their health problems, the number of application users which means increase the people that using nutrition apps, also the old applications will be overhauled.<br><br>

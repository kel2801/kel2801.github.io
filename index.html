<h1 style="color:red"> Interest in IT </h1>
<p>
_ My interest in IT is coding and solving computer issues. Because I was impressed by the logical and accurate of a code which is needed to make a software, or a program runs correctly and effectively without having mistaken. Besides, I usually deal with the computer issues, each time solving I was interested by how the problem occur and how to fix it effectively. <br><br>

_ My interest in IT start when I was in high school, on that time I get to know how to make a code and how to fix computer issues. Then start practicing with some simple math calculations and practice fixing problems from the simple one to the complicated one. 

_ Yes, a particular event as well as a person both sparked my interest. About an event, when I was in grade 12, in an informatics lesson the teacher taught about coding and how to make a code that do a math calculation then gave me and my class an amount of time to practice the activities by ourselves. After that practicing time, I started to find interest in IT when I success in making a logical code and make the program calculated correctly. Otherwise, I usually watch and learn from a technical supporter who is my mom’s friend each time he fixes my computer problems and he explain specifically about the problem occurred and how he is going to fix it.<br><br> 

_ I choose to come to RMIT because I see that it is the best environment to learn about IT with a lot of modern technical devices, many experience teachers who can teach in an effective way, and easy to create relationships to involve in projects while studying to extend knowledge by learning from each other. <br><br>

_ I expect to learn more about coding like what programs that we will write codes, types of code, areas that related to IT such as data, security, networking, a little bit of robotics, software. Besides academic knowledge, I also want to learn the way to think logically and accurately, skills that is needed to do the teamwork effectively during my studies. <br><br>

<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/ff30eb047f07a"> Personality result </a> <br>
<p> _ Those test results are meaningful to me. Because according to those results, I can evaluate and understand myself more specific and clearly about many different areas if my personality is capable from simplest and from the reality or behaviors in society. <br><br>		
_ I think those test results will motivate me to change and improve what I am not so good at or what I need to put a significant effort to be better. Otherwise, I can see the strengths that I owned but the others may not, so I can continue to keep and promote it as best as I can to make a more positive contribution with all the members in a group. <br><br> 
_ When forming a team, I suggest each person included me should do a test or all the members of a team should have a meeting to find out then evaluate specifically and clearly about all members personality, what are the strengths and weakness, what kind of word will be capable to do, and how the team is going to work with each other. <br><br>
